<h1>About Team Gamma</h1>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p>Team Gamma produces a web application for everyday tasks that people are motivated to use, is very accessible, 
and is as simple as possible, allowing for optional complexity</p>
<br />
<!-- <h3>Problem</h3>
<br />
<p>Most planner apps either have too much initial complexity, too high of a barrier to entry, 
or offer limited functionality as a tradeoff to minimalist design. 
Many people donâ€™t bother with these apps even though they could still benefit due to either too much perceived effort or lack of motivation, 
or search for one with more complexity if they become limited by the application currently being used.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
